# CM Internship 2021

## Project Examples 
Most of these project examples are side projects I worked on recently.
### Movie app nominations

### Yamigo 
Yamigo is an app idea I recently came up with.  Yamigo pairs you up with potential friends in a particular city based on your personality and your interests. This can be achieved by asking the user specific psychological questions or doing a quick personality test for the user. 
We live in a time where meaningful friendships have become  so invaluable and almost priceless. With globalization happening worldwide, people in their mid-twenties to early-thirties will always go to new cities and they will definitely be looking to make worthwhile connections with like-minded people. You might say, there's social media, there's facebook, there's MeetUp, there's Bumble Friends, there are friendship apps but if I were to ask people how many lasting connections they've made off these platforms, the value of these platforms dwindle.There are friendship apps out there, but these apps are still kind of a guessing game because itâ€™s quite hard knowing how you and someone would fit.

I believe this is something my business idea can exploit.

### Mobile news feed 

## Inspiration

### Kord
This is a streaming site that combines Spotify, Soundcloud and Youtube. It was built with React/Redux/Express/PostgreSQL. Chrome & Firefox browsers supported.

I was inspired  by this project because it was a platform that allowed users to combine playlists from different streaming platforms. The user can also search for music and get results from each of these platforms. 

This project intrigued me, as someone that enjoys creating playlists, friends always ask me to share my playlists with them. Most of my friends use either Apple Music, Deezer or Youtube Music, as a Spotify die hard fan, sharing playlists I made for them was challenging. I've always imagined building a platform that allows me upload a Spotify playlist link and export an Apple, Tidal or Youtube Music playlist link I can share with friends.

### NFTs 
 A non-fungible token is a digital record that is on the blockchain ledger. NFT confirms ownership of a certain digital object. With NFT technology, developers will be able to get rid of the problem of safeguarding ownership of digital items. 

 Everyone that has ownership rights to a particular object knows that it is the authentic one they have since information about this is safely stored in the blockchain.

 I was inspired by this technology because it gives digital creators the autonomy of presenting their work on their own.
